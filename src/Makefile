# If we are using libtool, we can rely on libraries to specify their own

#
# We must do this in order for bttcp to run even if the postgres/xml/etc.
# libraries are missing.

# <TRICKY>We don't want -lbkssl or -lbkxml for most of the programs here, and
# some of the programs don't need *anything* (e.g. bk_daemon); however, some
# programs (e.g. bttcp) do need -lbkssl.  To manage this mess, we use a fairly
# obscure GNU make feature, Target-specific Variables, to set variables
# differently for different targets.  Note that this won't necessarily do what
# we want if there are previous := assignments using the variable we're trying
# to override, but it works until somebody breaks it by getting fancy.</TRICKY>
